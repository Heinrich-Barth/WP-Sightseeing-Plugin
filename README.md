# WP-Sightseeing-Plugin
This Wordpress Plugin allows you to create one or more sight seeing tours (or traveling tours) which consist of several locations. 

A tour consists of several sights that will be listed and displayed on a map based on geo locations. There, you can also browse through all tours and jump to a sight's detail page.

A sights detail page is a simple Wordpress page and lists related tours and sights of a given tour.
